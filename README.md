# Weather

A small static Weather demo app (HTML/CSS/JS) that demonstrates a basic UI for displaying weather information.

## Features

- Example UI: current conditions and simple forecast placeholders.
- Responsive layout: works on desktop and mobile (basic styles in `style.css`).
- Static frontend only: no backend included, but designed for easy API integration.
- Easy to extend: hooks in `app.js` for adding a weather API (OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.).

## Files

- index.html — main page
- app.js — JavaScript logic (where to add API calls)
- style.css — styling

## How to run

Easiest (no server): open `index.html` directly in your browser. Some browser features (fetch, modules) may require a local server.
